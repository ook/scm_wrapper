SCM_WRAPPER
===========

SCM_WRAPPER is an attempt of high level SCM wrappers with a unified interface.
Maybe it already exists somewhere, but I haven't seen one before: each
project dealing with multiple SCMs I have seen use their own interfaces and
most of time use ugly exec calls instead of existings (but really doc-babelized)
ruby bindings, so... time to try to be efficient.

This library is extracted from the 'snitcher' rails project. Hoping that could
help at least a guy on Earth.

Oh! BTW: instead of killing people, just make love. Thank you.
